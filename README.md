# static-comp-one

A little about this static comp. This is the first time using flexbox with CSS. I choose John Muir as a subject because I think he is amazing and as the father of the national parks think that he needs to be well know in our society. I also agree with his philosophy of nature as a church and such a spiritual place.

this is also my first attempt at a compleate responsive layout. using Mobil first design.
